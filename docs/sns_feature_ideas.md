# SNS Feature Proposal: Pay Forward

**Core Concept**: A "Kindness Feed" where every post is a spark of positivity.
**Benchmark**: Instagram (Visual-first) + Text Flexibility.

## 1. Post Format (The "Deed")

### A. Visual Post (Photo/Video)
- **Use Case**: Photo of the coffee purchased, the thank-you note received, the scene of helping.
- **UI**: Full-width image/video with caption below.

### B. Text-Card Post (No Photo?)
- **Problem**: Text-only posts break the visual grid of an Instagram-like feed.
- **Solution**: **"Thought Cards"**
  - When a user writes only text, the app generates a beautiful card (Gradient/Solid Color/Pattern) with the text centered.
  - This ensures the grid remains visually appealing even without photos.

## 2. "Pay Forward" Interaction Mechanics

### Idea 1: The "Ripple Effect" (Chain Linking)
- **Concept**: Connect posts to show the flow of kindness.
- **Action**: When posting, you can tag a "Source Post" (e.g., "I did this because @UserA did that for me").
- **Visualization**: A "Ripple View" showing the family tree of a good deed.

### Idea 2: The "Kindness Token" (Gamification)
- **Concept**: A digital token that passes from person to person.
- **Action**: You "spend" a token to post a deed, or you "pass" a token to someone you helped.
- **Goal**: See how far your single token travels around the world.

### Idea 3: The "Impact Meter"
- **Concept**: Quantify the impact (e.g., "$ saved", "Hours given", "People smiled").
- **Action**: Simple counters on the profile showing total impact.

## 3. Feed Structure
- **Global Feed**: See kindness happening around the world (Discovery).
- **Ripple Feed**: See the chains of kindness you are part of.
- **Local Feed**: (Phase 2) Kindness happening near me.
